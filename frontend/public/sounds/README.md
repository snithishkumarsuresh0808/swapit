# Ringtone Setup

## Adding a Ringtone

To add a ringtone for incoming calls:

1. Download or create a ringtone audio file (MP3 format recommended)
2. Rename it to `ringtone.mp3`
3. Place it in this directory (`public/sounds/`)

## Recommended Sources

- **Free Ringtones:** https://www.zedge.net/ringtones
- **Create Your Own:** Use audio editing software like Audacity
- **Default System Sounds:** Use built-in system notification sounds

## Format Requirements

- **Format:** MP3, WAV, or OGG
- **Duration:** 3-10 seconds (will loop)
- **File Name:** `ringtone.mp3`
- **Size:** Under 500KB recommended

## Alternative: Use a Simple Beep

If you don't have a ringtone file, the app will attempt to play the file but fail gracefully.

## Testing

After adding the ringtone:
1. Make sure the file is named exactly `ringtone.mp3`
2. Test by having someone call you in the app
3. Make sure your browser allows audio autoplay (check browser settings)
